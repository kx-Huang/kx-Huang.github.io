## My Badminton Career

I started training badminton professionally in Shanghai Luwan Badminton Team when I was 5 years old. After Luwan District got merged into Huangpu District, I became a member of Shanghai HuangPu Badminton Team.

During my time there, I met my former Men's Doubles partner [**Jiang Zhenbang**](https://bwfbadminton.com/player/63029/jiang-zhen-bang){:target="\_blank"}, whose currently **BWF World Rankings is 4** in Mixed Doubles and won 2023 Asian Championships. We played a few tournaments together before he attended China National Badminton Team.

After that, I played in Shanghai Jiao Tong University and University of Michigan badminton team. It deserves highlight that I won championships for UMich at the US Collegiate Badminton Competition in 2024.
